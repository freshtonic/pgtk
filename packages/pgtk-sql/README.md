# pgtk-sql

Postgres-flavoured SQL parser based on `recursa`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] 100% accuracy with Postgres SQL syntax (as of version 17)
- [ ] Passes Postgres's SQL parser regression tests
- [x] Generate accurate railroad diagrams from the syntax tree
- [ ] Impossible to represent invalid SQL with the AST
- [x] Support quickcheck-style testing: optional Arbitrary impl feature
- [ ] PGPLSQL support behind feature flag
- [x] Benchmark (runnable in CI to catch regressions)
- [x] Support "super flat" ASTs https://jhwlr.io/super-flat-ast/ — see
      [Flat AST](#flat-ast)

## Build time

The build script of pgtk-sql generates the parser with `recursa-codegen`, and
the grammar analysis of `recursa-codegen` uses much CPU. Cargo compiles a build
script and its dependencies with `opt-level = 0` by default, and at that level
the analysis is very slow (more than 15 minutes on an Apple M-series CPU). Add
this to the `Cargo.toml` of your workspace root:

```toml
[profile.dev.build-override]
opt-level = 3

[profile.release.build-override]
opt-level = 3
```

With this setting, the analysis takes approximately 14 seconds. The setting
changes only how Cargo compiles build scripts and procedural macros, not your
code. Cargo reads profiles only from the workspace root, so pgtk-sql cannot set
it for you. The pgtk workspace has the same setting.

## Target versions

A pgtk-sql build reproduces the raw parser of one PostgreSQL major version, its
target version. Select it with exactly one Cargo feature:

| Feature | PostgreSQL release |
|---|---|
| `pg14` | 14.24 |
| `pg15` | 15.19 |
| `pg16` | 16.15 |
| `pg17` (default) | 17.11 |
| `pg18` | 18.6 |
| `pg19-beta` | `REL_19_STABLE` at `b73d13c` |

```toml
pgtk-sql = { path = "../pgtk-sql", default-features = false, features = ["pg16", "spans"] }
```

The features are mutually exclusive: the build stops with an error for zero
or for two or more. Cargo feature unification is the usual cause of two. A
crate between your crate and pgtk-sql must use `default-features = false` on
pgtk-sql and forward the version features, as `pgtk-psql` does.
`pgtk_sql::TARGET_VERSION` reports the selection. The grammar of `pg14`,
`pg15` and `pg16` is complete (#74 to #76). The grammar of `pg18` and
`pg19-beta` is not complete yet (#77, #78). See ADR 0009 and
`docs/plans/2026-09-22-target-versions.md`.

`cargo loop` is the edit loop: it tests pgtk-sql in the merge gate's
configuration, so `cargo loop --test embedded` and the gate share one build.
`scripts/merge-gate` proves that configuration before a merge, and
`scripts/release-gate` builds and tests every target version before a
release (ADR 0011). `docs/notes/build-times.md` records what the build costs
and what was tried against it.

### The minimum version of a statement

A build fixes the grammar, but the server that runs the SQL can be older.
`pgtk_sql::minimum_version` answers, for one parsed statement, the lowest target
version whose grammar accepts it, and the first construct that a given older
version rejects. Where `gram.y` raises a specific `ereport` in that older
version, the answer carries its SQLSTATE, message and hint.

```rust,ignore
use pgtk_sql::{MinimumVersion, TargetVersion};

if let Some(found) = parsed.minimum_version_above(TargetVersion::Pg15) {
    // "subquery in FROM must have an alias", 42601, needs PostgreSQL 16,
    // with the span of the subquery that lacks it.
    eprintln!("{:?} {:?}: {:?}", found.version(), found.span(), found.message());
}
```

The answer comes from the version gates, which are declarations that Recursa
records, so no list can drift from them. `docs/minimum-version.md` describes
the classes of gate, the lexical scan that goes with the parsed value, and
what the answer does not cover. See ADR 0010.

## Oracles

Two oracles check the parsers against PostgreSQL itself, both built from the
pinned release of the build's target version (`pgtk-oracle/pins.tsv`):

| Crate | Links | Checked by |
|---|---|---|
| `pgtk-oracle` | PostgreSQL's raw parser | `cargo test -p pgtk-sql --features postgres-oracle --test differential` |
| `pgtk-psql-oracle` | psql's `psqlscan.l` and `psqlscanslash.l` | `cargo test -p pgtk-psql --features psql-oracle` |

Each first build extracts the pinned commit from the `vendor/postgres` object
store and builds PostgreSQL. Fetch the pins first with
`scripts/fetch-postgres-pins`. See `docs/differential-baseline.md` and
`docs/psql-oracle.md`.

## Toolchain

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins a dated nightly. The dev loop compiles the
generated grammar with the parallel rustc front end (`-Z threads` in
`.cargo/config.toml`), which stable rustc does not accept. If your shell
exports `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`, it overrides the file; unset it in this
workspace.

## Flat AST

The grammar root selects Recursa's `flat` flag, so every `ast_node!`
declaration has a second concrete representation beside the nested arena AST:
one contiguous, handle-addressed store per parse. `Statement::parse_flat` and
`Statement::parse_flat_without_spans` sit beside `parse` and
`parse_without_spans`, run the same lexer and the same LR automaton, and
return a `FlatAst` that renders exactly what the detached nested AST renders.

`Expr`, `ColumnRef`, `FuncCall`, `SelectStmt` and `Statement` carry
`#[flat(pool)]`, which gives each its own typed pool; every other declaration
reaches the shared word pool. `tests/flat_parity.rs` proves nested/flat
recognition and rendering parity over every statement the differential
baseline pins, with no PostgreSQL oracle needed:

```bash
cargo test -p pgtk-sql --test flat_parity
cargo test -p pgtk-sql --features spans --test flat_parity
```

The design lives in Recursa's `docs/flat-ast-design.md`.

## Benchmarks

The `parse` bench measures pgtk-sql parser throughput and compares it against
its own Flat AST (the `pgtk-sql-flat` engine), `sqlparser-rs`
(`PostgreSqlDialect`), and the raw parser of the target version's pinned
PostgreSQL release (17.11 by default). `pgtk-sql` and
`pgtk-sql-flat` share the lex pass and the automaton, so the pair isolates the
representation; the harness refuses to report timings unless the two accept
exactly the same statements.

Run everything:

```bash
cargo bench -p pgtk-sql --features postgres-oracle
```

Filter to one group:

```bash
cargo bench -p pgtk-sql --features postgres-oracle -- corpus/head-to-head
cargo bench -p pgtk-sql --features postgres-oracle -- stress/insert_values
```

Groups:

- `corpus/pgtk-sql-full` — parse every file under `fixtures/sql/`, reports MB/s.
- `corpus/head-to-head` — parse the set of files accepted by *both* parsers;
  compares pgtk-sql vs sqlparser directly.
- `stress/<shape>` — per-shape scaling curves over generated stress inputs
  (`insert_values`, `bool_chain`, `select_list`, `nested_subquery`, `in_list`).
- `stress/aggregate` — single regression-check measurement across all stress
  files.

Every group is capped at 1 s of measurement time and 10 samples so a single
slow case can't stall the suite.

### Regenerating stress fixtures

Stress fixtures live in `fixtures/stress/` and are deterministic. Regenerate
with:

```bash
cargo run --bin gen-stress -p pgtk-sql
```
