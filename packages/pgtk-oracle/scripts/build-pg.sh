# Builds the pinned PostgreSQL release of one target version far enough that
# pgtk-oracle can link its parser. Idempotent: safe to re-run.
#
# Usage: build-pg.sh [FEATURE [TREE]]
#
#   FEATURE  a version feature from pgtk-oracle/pins.tsv (default: pg17).
#   TREE     the directory for the source tree and the build. The default
#            is the shared cache (ADR 0012): <cache>/<ref>-<commit>, where
#            <cache> is $PG_SQL_POSTGRES_CACHE, else
#            ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/pgtk-sql/postgres. Both oracle build
#            scripts use this default, so every checkout and worktree on the
#            machine builds each pinned release once.
#
# The pinned commit comes from pgtk-oracle/pins.tsv. The script extracts that
# commit from the object store of the `vendor/postgres` Git submodule with
# `git archive`, then configures and builds it in TREE. The submodule
# checkout does not change. The file TREE/pgtk-oracle-source-commit records the
# commit of the tree. The default tree name carries the commit, so a moved
# pin gets a new tree beside the old one; a TREE given by hand that holds
# another commit is removed and built again, because PostgreSQL is configured
# without dependency tracking. A lock file beside the tree serialises builds
# of the same tree from several checkouts.

# PostgreSQL's makefiles interpret PROFILE as compiler profiling flags. Cargo
# exports PROFILE=debug/release to build scripts, so do not leak it into make.
