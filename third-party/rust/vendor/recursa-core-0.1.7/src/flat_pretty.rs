//! The rendering contract one generated flat Node type implements per Flat AST store.
//!
//! A nested Node owns its children, so [`crate::Pretty`] needs nothing but the value itself. A
//! flat Node holds four-byte handles, so a render of one needs the store that resolves them. This
//! module supplies the one trait that carries the store beside the value. [`crate::flat_owner`]
//! supplies the storage selection that trait's implementations read through.
//!
//! Recursa's generator implements this trait once per flat Node type, against the grammar's own
//! `FlatAst` owner. The owner's `pretty`, `render`, `render_with` and `pretty_node` methods
//! dispatch through it, so one generic method renders any Node of the grammar.
//!
//! A flat render carries no occurrence provenance. It therefore emits the canonical spelling of
//! every fixed token, and it omits optional fixed syntax it cannot have captured. A detached
//! nested AST does exactly the same.
//!
//! `docs/flat-ast-design.md` settles the owner API and
//! `docs/adr/0008-keep-flat-asts-semantic-only.md` records the rendering contract.
