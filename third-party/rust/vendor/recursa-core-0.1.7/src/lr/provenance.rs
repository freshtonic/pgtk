//! The occurrence stack of the table-driven parser: provenance folded on reduce (#118).
//!
//! When a parse captures provenance, every state-stack frame has one entry here, pushed on
//! shift with the token's span and folded on reduce into the occurrence described by the rule's
//! generated provenance data. When capture is off the stack does not exist, and the loop in
//! [`super`] never touches it.
//!
//! The fold of a rule is data, not code: a [`RuleFold`] decoded from the packed `folds` table
//! codegen renders from the same site forms its reduce actions come from. A construction rule
//! folds to one node whose children are its sites in grammar-element order; each site kind names
//! the leaf, group, presence, repetition, or pass-through shape for that element. Helper rules
//! (`opt(...)`, `presence(...)`, `list(...)`) fold to the occurrence their inlined form denotes,
//! so a site that delegates to a helper passes the helper's entry through. Every occurrence goes
//! through the same collector, so compaction and span validation stay centralized.
//!
//! A site's explicit capture policy stands, while an inherited policy uses the root entry type's
//! `CAPTURE_POLICY`. A grammar whose nodes override the policy below the root is rejected at
//! generation time (`RCA0406`), because a child rule is reduced before the consuming site is
//! known.
