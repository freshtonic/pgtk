//! The type-erased value stack of the table-driven parser.
//!
//! A reduce action pops the values of its rule's value-carrying symbols and pushes the value it
//! constructs; the automaton loop never inspects a value. Every value therefore lives as raw
//! bytes in one buffer, with a parallel drop stack that remembers where each value starts and
//! how to drop it, so that a failed or abandoned parse can release every partially built value
//! without knowing its type. Fixed tokens never reach this stack (section 6 of
//! `docs/table-driven-parsing.md`): only the state stack sees them.
//!
//! # Safety model
//!
//! The buffer is a vector of 16-byte aligned units, so a value whose alignment is at most 16 can
//! be stored at an offset rounded up to its alignment and read back with an aligned pointer.
//! [`ValueStack::push`] is safe: it copies the value's bytes in and records its drop glue.
//! [`ValueStack::pop`] is `unsafe` because the stack cannot check that the requested type is the
//! type that was pushed; the generated reduce actions guarantee it because both sides are derived
//! from the same grammar rule. A size mismatch is caught by a debug assertion.
