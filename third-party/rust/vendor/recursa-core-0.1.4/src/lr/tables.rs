//! The packed LALR(1) tables and their decoder.
//!
//! The tables mirror bison's `yypact`, `yytable`, `yycheck`, `yydefact`, `yypgoto`, `yydefgoto`,
//! `yyr1` and `yyr2`, plus Recursa's `value_pops` and `reduce_actions` per rule,
//! `expected_atoms` per terminal
//! (the symbolic expectation the error path names a terminal by) and its `lookahead` filter
//! table, the flat `(token, merged, trigger)` triples of the grammar's `lookahead`
//! declarations, which [`DecodedTables::merged_terminal`] applies to the token feed. Codegen
//! packs them (`recursa_codegen::lr::tables`) with URL-safe base64 and renders each as one
//! byte-string literal so a table costs the compiler one token; this module is the runtime half
//! of that format and must agree with the codegen encoder cell for cell.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! A literal is one base64 digit giving the cell width, then `width` digits per cell, in the
//! URL-safe alphabet below. Unsigned tables store the cell value. Signed tables
//! store `0` for the sentinel [`PACT_NINF`] and otherwise the zigzag form of the value plus one,
//! so small magnitudes keep small widths.
//!
//! # Lookup contract
//!
//! - action on terminal `t` in state `s`: if `pact[s] == PACT_NINF` take `defact[s]`; else let
//!   `i = pact[s] + t`; if `0 <= i < table.len()` and `check[i] == t` the entry is `table[i]`,
//!   otherwise take `defact[s]`.
//! - `table[i] > 0` shifts to state `table[i]`; `table[i] < 0` reduces by rule `-table[i] - 1`;
//!   `table[i] == TABLE_NINF` is an explicit error.
//! - `defact[s] == 0` is an error; otherwise reduce by rule `defact[s] - 1`.
//! - goto on nonterminal `n` from state `s`: let `i = pgoto[n] + s`; if in range and
//!   `check[i] == s` go to `table[i]`, otherwise `defgoto[n]`.
