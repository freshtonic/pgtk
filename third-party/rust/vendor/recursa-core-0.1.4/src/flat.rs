//! Flat AST storage primitives: handles, typed pools, the shared pool, the list store, the text
//! pool, and side tables.
//!
//! One parsed result owns one Flat AST store. The store keeps every Node of a pooled Node type in
//! its own [`TypedPool`]. It keeps every other Node in one [`SharedPool`] of four-byte words. It
//! keeps every list of handles in one [`ListStore`], and every content token's text in one
//! [`TextPool`]. Nodes refer to one another through four-byte typed handles, never through
//! pointers. `docs/flat-ast-design.md` settles the design and
//! `docs/adr/0012-tiered-flat-storage.md` records the decision.
//!
//! Every part is append-only. A handle stays valid for the life of the store. No slot is removed,
//! reused, or compacted. This module therefore exposes no mutable Node access: there is no
//! `get_mut`, and a pool has no `IndexMut`. Mutation is a later milestone. A [`SideTable`] is the
//! one exception, because a consumer owns its values and a write to them does not change the AST.
//!
//! # Recycling
//!
//! A batch consumer parses one statement after another. Every store has a `clear` that ends one
//! result and keeps that result's capacity, and a `reserve` that tops the capacity up without
//! allocating when it is already enough, so the next parse starts warm and allocates nothing.
//! Clearing ends the result: every handle of the cleared contents is stale from that moment, and
//! the next push takes its index. A handle belongs to one result by contract, which
//! `docs/adr/0009-give-each-flat-ast-its-own-typed-stores.md` already states, and no type can stop
//! a stale handle. [`TextPool::into_recycled`] is the one store operation that also drops the
//! input borrow, because recycled capacity must outlive the input it was filled from.
//!
//! # Handle encoding
//!
//! Every handle is `#[repr(transparent)]` over [`NonZeroU32`], so an optional handle is also four
//! bytes. A pool interprets the raw value. The handle type does not know which pool holds it.
//!
//! - A typed pool, the text pool, and a side table read the raw value as `index + 1`.
//! - The shared pool and the list store read it as an offset into their word or slot vector. Slot
//!   zero of each one is reserved and never allocated, so the value is never zero.
//!
//! A handle never wraps, truncates, or becomes zero. An exhausted `u32` range is a checked panic
//! with a clear message in every build, as
//! `docs/adr/0009-give-each-flat-ast-its-own-typed-stores.md` requires.
//!
//! # Safety model
//!
//! The shared pool stores whole four-byte words. Every flat Node has an alignment of at most four
//! bytes: a handle is a `u32`, a list handle is two `u32`, and a [`Span`] is two `u32`. A
//! `Vec<u32>` buffer is four-byte aligned. A Node written at a word offset can therefore be read
//! back through an aligned pointer.
//!
//! [`SharedPool::alloc`] asserts `align_of::<T>() <= 4` at compile time. [`SharedPool::get`]
//! performs the only pointer cast. Three things guard that cast: the typed handle, which is
//! invariant I3, the bounds check, and a type tag word in debug and test builds.
//!
//! The list store reads a run of `u32` slots as a slice of handles. That is sound for two
//! reasons: the store wrote every slot from a handle's raw value, which is invariant I4, and
//! [`ListItem`] requires a transparent representation.
//!
//! The value stack in this crate is the precedent for both the confinement and the documentation
//! style. This module's tests run under Miri in CI.
