//! Lookahead correction: the expected set of a table-driven parse error.
//!
//! LALR(1) with default reductions may detect an error only after reductions triggered by the
//! failing token, so the final state's row can name fewer
//! continuations than were possible: after `( id + id` the end of input reduces `T -> F` and
//! `E -> E + T` before failing in `F -> ( E . )`, whose row is `+` and `)`, although `*` could
//! have continued `T -> T . * F`. Bison's lookahead correction (`parse.lac`) answers this by
//! exploring from the stack as it was before those reductions. Recursa does the same on the
//! error path only.
//!
//! The pre-reduction stack is not kept on the hot path. The state stack at any cursor is a
//! function of the tokens consumed since the parse began, so [`expected_set`] replays the
//! automaton, states only, from the parse's origin to the moment the failing token was first
//! read (default reductions taken without a lookahead do not depend on the token, so replaying
//! them is exact), then simulates every terminal of the grammar on a scratch copy of that stack
//! until it is shifted, accepted or rejected. The terminals that are shifted or accepted form
//! the expected set; each is named by the canonical atom of its token kind, so
//! [`ParseError::expected`](crate::ParseError::expected) renders stable names. The end marker is not explored: it has no atom
//! and no kind bit, so nothing could report it. A terminal whose exploration reaches the accept
//! rule counts as a continuation, since the parse would have ended without an error on it.
