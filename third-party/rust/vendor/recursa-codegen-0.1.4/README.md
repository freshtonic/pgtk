# recursa-codegen

`recursa-codegen` is Recursa's build-time generator. It discovers an authored
Rust grammar module, resolves and lowers its grammar model, performs lexical and
semantic analysis, reports structured diagnostics, and publishes one complete
generation for the matching facade and structural loaders.

Applications normally use its public `generate` function from `build.rs`:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), recursa_codegen::GenerateError> {
    recursa_codegen::generate("src/grammar.rs")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The path is relative to the package manifest. The generator owns Cargo
invalidation for the selected Rust module tree. Consumers should not inspect
`OUT_DIR` or include generated files themselves; `recursa::grammar!` and
`recursa::ast_node!` load the matching generation. Node declarations describe
relationships and cardinalities; the generator resolves their concrete nested
containers and required lifetimes under the grammar's storage policy.

examples.

## Analysis API

The crate also exposes source-independent grammar IR, FIRST/FOLLOW and
lookahead analysis, decision products, provenance, and structured diagnostic
types. These are advanced analysis interfaces; authored-source discovery and
the generation protocol remain generator-owned implementation details.

## Features

No features are enabled by default.

- `diagrams` plans semantic railroad diagrams for aggregate grammar Rustdoc and
  for each generated Node and content-token type. The generator publishes only
  the encoded plan; the `recursa` facade renders SVG while `cargo doc` expands
  the generated `cfg(doc)` attributes, so ordinary builds carry no diagram
  markup. Request it with `diagrams` in `recursa::grammar!`; content tokens may
  use `#[lex(pattern = r"...", diagram = "human label")]`, otherwise the regex
  is the deterministic label. Fixed-token terminals are syntax-only.
- `explorer` generates grammar-erased Explorer adapters for eligible roots.
- Generated parsers always expose `parse_without_spans` alongside ordinary
  parse entry points. `spans` generates exact-source framing and, with the
  matching facade feature, permits ordinary provenance capture.

Enable the matching capability on the `recursa` facade when a generated grammar
uses it.

Recursa uses Rust edition 2024 and requires Rust 1.88 or newer. See the
[API reference](https://docs.rs/recursa-codegen/latest/recursa_codegen/) and
the [facade setup](https://github.com/freshtonic/recursa/tree/main/recursa).
