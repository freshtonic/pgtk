#![deny(missing_docs, clippy::missing_docs_in_private_items)]

//! LR(0) item sets, LALR(1) lookaheads and conflict detection.
//!
//! The construction is the one bison uses: LR(0) states from every start rule, then lookaheads
//! by DeRemer and Pennello's `reads`, `includes` and `lookback` relations over the digraph
//! algorithm. Shift/reduce conflicts go through a [`ConflictResolver`] seam, which declared
//! precedence implements; a resolved conflict is recorded, not reported. Without a resolution a
//! shift/reduce conflict keeps the shift and a reduce/reduce conflict keeps the lowest rule, as
//! bison does, and both are reported.
//!
//! Prefix acceptance shapes two details. The synthetic start rule `S'(T) -> T` has the end marker
//! as its only lookahead, and the end marker means "no other action applies" at runtime; the
//! state's default reduction therefore prefers the reduce whose lookahead holds the end marker,
//! so a root ends when the next token has no shift action, as the design's prefix acceptance
//! requires.
//!
//! One start rule per grammar type puts the end marker in the FOLLOW of every nonterminal that
//! can end some root. That never makes a shift/reduce conflict, because no rule shifts the end
//! marker; it makes reduce/reduce conflicts on the end marker alone between rules that can each
//! end a root, merged into one LALR(1) state by their shared LR(0) core. When every such rule
//! wraps one thing — a token wrapper (`ColIdText -> IDENT .` beside
//! `TypeFunctionNameText -> IDENT .`) or a unit rule of a grammar type
//! (`Expr -> SelectWithParens .` beside `SelectClause -> SelectWithParens .`) — and the end
//! marker is the one cell of the state those rules still contest, the construction takes the
//! earliest-declared rule, as bison does, records an [`EndMarkerResolution`], and does not count
//! a conflict; see [`EndMarkerResolution`] for why that is safe and where its limit is.

///   an `A`.
///
/// The safety argument is one argument for both shapes. Every complete item of such a state has
/// its dot at position one, so the symbol that reached the state is the whole right-hand side of
/// every competitor: the competitors differ in their left-hand side alone, never in what they
/// pop. The end marker is the lookahead only when the parse is ending: at the end of input, or
/// at a token no continuation of any competitor accepts, where every choice fails at that same
/// token. So the choice decides only which wrapper a prefix parse yields when the input stops
/// after the wrapped symbol; the explicit action of every continuation terminal is untouched, so
/// a root that continues past the wrapper still reduces the right one — a continuation terminal
/// one root accepts and another does not keeps its own action, and the end-marker cell is the
/// only cell this rule writes.
///
/// What the argument asks of every other lookahead is an explicit action, which is why the guard
/// (`settled_by_declaration_order`) reads the conflicts that remain rather than the raw
/// lookahead sets. A cell that precedence or an authored scoped `lr_conflict` declaration
/// settled carries one; a cell those two leave contested is a hard error, and the whole
/// reduce/reduce is then reported on every cell it occupies, the end marker included. That is
/// also how the rule meets its consumer: pg-sql's `Expr -> SelectWithParens` beside
/// `SelectClause -> SelectWithParens` compete on `RPAREN`, `RPAREN_SELECT_LA` and `RETURNING`
/// too, and those three a declaration can name. The end marker is the one it cannot, because a
/// scoped lookahead may only be a token or a merged kind.
///
/// The choice is exact for each root context in which the earliest-declared rule can end the
/// parse. A root context that can end only in a later-declared rule is an LALR(1) merge artefact
/// of the per-type start rules, and its remedy is declaration order.
///
/// Two consequences of that shared right-hand side are worth naming. A **mixed** competition
/// between a token wrapper and a unit rule cannot arise: a token wrapper's one symbol is a
/// terminal and a unit rule's is a nonterminal, so the two can never be complete in one state.
