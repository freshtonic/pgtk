//! Configuration requirements recorded by declared build-configuration gates.
//!
//! A grammar names an ordered list of configurations, and a `#[config(since = ...)]` gate both
//! removes its element from a build that excludes it and records that the element needs that
//! configuration. Generation publishes one static [`RequirementNote`] per gated construct and
//! one [`Requires`] implementation per Node. A scan over a parsed value answers two questions:
//! the lowest configuration whose grammar accepts the value, and the first construct, in source
//! order, whose requirement is above a given configuration.
//!
//! Three storages answer them, and this module holds the one fold, the one ceiling test and the
//! one answer that all three use. A value and an arena-parsed value walk the value itself with
//! the occurrence cursor. A flat parse holds no such value, so generation walks the stores
//! instead and records each extent through [`RequirementScan::record_span`]. The walk differs;
//! nothing below it does.
